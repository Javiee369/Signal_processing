***Signal analysis project 1st semester 2023***

Develop a Python program to calculate the electrical parameters of an industrial low-voltage network.

The industrial low voltage network is configured as shown in the single line diagram and is duly instrumented at nodes 1, 2 and 3. This system will take the signals corresponding to the phase voltages and line currents from a data acquisition system.

1. Develop in Colaboratory a Line Analyser that displays the following information for nodes 1 to 4:

    ```
    -The three-phase signals over time for v(t), i(t) and the current through the neutral.
    -The power of each of the signals.
    -The phasor diagrams by phase and line. 
    -The power triangles. 
    -The instantaneous powers per phase. 
    -The r.m.s. values of voltages and currents. 
    -The active power values per phase and total. 
    -The reactive power values per phase and total. 
    -The apparent power values per phase and total.
    ```
